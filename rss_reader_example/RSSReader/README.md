# RSS FEED

Hi Cater2.me team!

## How to setup:

in the Rails project directory:

`$ bundle install`
`$ npm --yes init`
`$ npm install`
`$ webpack`
`$ rake test`
`$ rails s`

navigate to:

`http://localhost:3000`

enter the feed link to an RSS feed in the box,
maybe try: http://ppe.sagepub.com/rss/current.xml
